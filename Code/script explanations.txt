#### Calcom library
- used to perform calculations and build models


#### Metabolomics.py
- an extension to the calcom library for metabolomics


#### Iterative_feature_removal.py (script 1)
- removes features between healthy control groups

- This script should be run in segments, as there are hyper-parameter tuning steps which require variable user input.

#### Feature_selection.py (script 2)
- Combines feature sets across different imputation/normalization schemes. The features can then be sent for evaluation, peak quality and targeting in Skyline

#### Combine_feature_sets.py (script 3)
- Combines feature sets across different imputation/normalization schemes. The features can then be sent for evaluation, peak quality and targeting in Skyline.

#### Test_features.py
- From my head = test features

#### Test_targeted_features.py (script 4)
- Used to evaluate test performance of the model according to features targeted in Skyline. Should be run in segments.

#### Test_targeted_log_features.py (optional script 4)
