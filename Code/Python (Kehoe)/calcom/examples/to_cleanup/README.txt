Many of these are in "to_cleanup" because 
they rely on datasets which are one or more of 

(a) Not in the calcom github;
(b) Aren't publicly available;
(c) Use too much old/outdated methodology;
(d) Too cluttered with setting parameters.

Part (d) isn't the worst thing, but 
belongs in a third or fourth example after 
the basic idea has been established.
