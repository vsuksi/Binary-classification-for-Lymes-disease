# To-do

**Only list specific and actionable things, for example: pick up your package at R-kioski! The slow burn list is not about getting shit done, but more about remembering the things which I want to get done at some point.**

**Enter tasks in a rough order of importance!**

```{r, child=if (!SSVM) 'appendix.Rmd'} add this back to report.rmd when it works otherwise

Save the environment to .yml again, igraph package was added (conda install)

Do the funcking Cairo thingamadinghy

Rename the GitHub repository accordingly: commit and push, then delete it locally and clone from GitHub after renaming it there

package 'biostrings' is not available for Bioconductor version '3.14'

Conda compare the activated lyme_main environment with lyme_main.yml

Make limit_features so that it works with the data in report.rmd

Run feature importance with the same three data splits as Dorde

Check how to plot number of features vs accuracy, choose which method/library to use (same as Leo in analysis?)

Try creating an environment from lyme_main.yml

Compare dataset.csv with dataset_after_knn.csv

Make get_feature_importance() compatible with whatever method the user chooses.

Make a project folder make scripts for the individual code chunks in a "code chunks" -folder

Test rendering the cached test_project.qmd with environment lyme_main

Try using the parallel processing one more time for get_feature_importance() in spite of it not working last time

Run feature importance with folds 2020-2022

Try to specify the train-test split for SSVM or try to use the trained model to predict samples from training data

Do baseline for CoDaCoRe

Make a random baseline for the Python SSVM, overnight! Also use different baseline scores?

Train the logistic regression model using the same seed (2020, 2021 or 2022) and train-test split (0.75) to see if you get the same results as Dorde.
