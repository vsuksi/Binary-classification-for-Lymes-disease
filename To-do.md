# To-do

**Only list specific and actionable things, for example: pick up your package at R-kioski! The slow burn list is not about getting shit done, but more about remembering the things which I want to get done at some point.**

**Enter tasks in a rough order of importance!**

Check how to plot number of features vs accuracy, choose which method/library to use (same as Leo in analysis?)

Change .qmd color scheme to R markdown

Test rendering from R if it won't work otherwise

Try creating an environment from lyme_main.yml

Compare dataset.csv with dataset_after_knn.csv

Try running Leo's pipeline to see if it about works with your environment

Make get_feature_importance() compatible with whatever method the user chooses.

Make a project folder make scripts for the individual code chunks in a "code chunks" -folder

Test rendering the cached test_project.qmd with environment lyme_main

Try using the parallel processing one more time for get_feature_importance()

Do a mean for CoDaCoRe (n=100), otherwise it will give you values that are all over the place af

Make the whole Quarto pipeline รก la Leo

Run feature importance with folds 2020-2022

Try to specify the train-test split for SSVM?

Test get_feature_importance with nperms < 100

Test if you get similar accuracy with other values of x, also for accuracy

Do baseline for CoDaCoRe

Try finding feature importance with 0 and 1 levels and twoClassSummary, check that you get the same results as with multiClassSummary

How to plot the number of features against accuracy?

Change all the dfbinary to df

Make a random baseline for the Python SSVM, overnight! Also use different baseline scores?

Run feature importance again with different seeds and different train/test splits?

Model logistic baseline with 4 important features.

Disable the tree view scroll bar!

Train the logistic regression model using the same seed (2020, 2021 or 2022) and train-test split (0.75) to see if you get the same results as Dorde. Then,
train the logistic regression model using only the four features found by the feature importance, using the same train-test split, and see if you still get the same result!
