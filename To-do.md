# To-do

**It is in the nature of thought work to get stuck every once in a while. And it does not help to try harder. As with walking or taking a break in general, switching one's focus to another task will often solve the problem effortlessly while maintaining a feeling of productivity. Switching tasks is greatly helped by a to-do list, as one doesn't have to come up with a task to perform.**

**Only list specific and actionable things, for example: pick up your package at R-kioski!**

**Enter tasks in a rough order of importance! Tasks that do not further the body of the work can be included under "slow burn".**
