# Results

## 4.11.2022
Testing whether I get the same results on each run and if translating feature values (xtrain = xtrain + x, xtest = xtest + x) with different distances x. The model does not seem to care about the translation distance.

I also tested the effect of the regularization parameter lambda, which is best set to 0 for optimal accuracy (0.87).
