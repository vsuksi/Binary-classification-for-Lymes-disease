Penguins dataset
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is a data set of three species of penguins 
in Antarctica. The basic machine learning task is 
to classify the species of penguin, given four 
different real-valued biological characteristics. 
There are many interesting directions for extension 
beyond this though, given additional information 
provided in the raw data.

to what we're doing; I've just copied the file

The way this data set is loaded in calcom, we 
expect to use it similar to the classic iris data set -- 
given four biological characteristics, try to distinguish 
between three types of penguins. There is a lot of 
auxilliary variables coming with this data that might be 
fun to work with, e.g., doing geolocation, sex differences, etc.
